# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> COME BACK TO THIS PIECE


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Github Docs (SSH keygen for local). Youtube (TypeScript functions/classes). Node Docs. Typescript Docs. 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 4-6 hours. A lot of it was installing the proper software on a new machine. About 2-3 hours to make sense of the code base & map out how I want to write classes. Maybe 1-2 hours of coding. Another 1 to figure out SSH keys & cloning.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 4 - Assignment wasn't necessarily hard. But being new to good architecture, I had some design questions I had to consider. More so, 
my first exposure to a "codebase" of an actual implemented module. 


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Not any I can think of.
